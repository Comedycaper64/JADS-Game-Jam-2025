      simply added speculations"
    - "You\u2019ve spun every clue into aggrandising your own ego, while nothing
      in this room points to you staying here. In fact, why would a gang, having
      cut off your hand to send a message, deliver it at the victim\u2019s address?"
    - "You really haven\u2019t thought this through have you?"

      doesn\u2019t matter."

      their gang, then cut off your hand and left it in your room for someone you
      knew to dissuade them, probably a detective friend or something, doesn\u2019t
      matter."
