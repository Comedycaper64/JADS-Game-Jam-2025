    dialogue:
    - 'Unfortunately I must agree with her. The backpack being for cover makes sense,
      but it starts falling apart when you take the following into consideration:
      Why would you have two toothbrushes? And two phone chargers?'

    - Also to get into character, wrinkly clothes and a re-worn T-shirt may help
