    dialogue:
    - You stand before a lectern with an empty notebook before you. Two more lecterns
      are on either side of you, giving you the sense that you arrived early for
      something.
    - Only a few heartbeats later the darkness behind an elevated pulpit stirs. Two
      bright yellow eyes pierce the darkness and a scaly head emerges from the shadow.
    - Raising its head, a monstrous body emerges from the alcove. A red dragon sits
      before you.

    - The court is ready to hear your case now, let me read you through the rules
      so we can get going as quick as possible!
    - Welcome to the Court of Unsolved Mortal Issues. UMI Court, for short.
    - Your soul has found no rest after it has left your body. As such, a trial will
      commence with you and the souls of the people you felt closest to at your time
      of passing.
    - Shortly, I shall summon them and proceed to trial, any questions?

    - "<i>Fine</i>. I\u2019ll explain this once, so pay attention will you?"
    - "Hello, <b>you are dead</b>. But for some reason you couldn\u2019t just pass
      on to the afterlife like every other normal person. Stubborn people like you
      feel like they\u2019re owed something after their death. There\u2019s an entire
      waiting list so let\u2019s not dawdle okay?"
    - We call cases such as yours "limbics". Those that remain in limbo. We have
      developed this court system to help you stubborn asses on your way.
    - "Rules of the court state that you aren\u2019t allowed your memories, for your
      judgement in the trial needs to be impartial. If you don\u2019t know who you
      are, don\u2019t worry, neither do I."
    - "Now, with all that out of the way, just point at one of these two people and
      say \u2018that person is the culprit\u2019. They'll get sent to damnation and
      we can wrap this up and all go on our merry way."
