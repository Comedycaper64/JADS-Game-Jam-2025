    - 'This is my theory: All the evidence points to me having been murdered by organized
      crime.'
    - You two were probably gang members that first tortured me, then let me go,
      maybe to set me up to reveal a safehouse of sorts.
    - Then together, you murdered me with a bat, cut off my hands with a knife to
      send a message and dumped my body in a trash container to get rid of the body.

    dialogue:
    - Your entire theory hangs together by nothing but wild speculation, do you really
      want to send an innocent person to damnation on a whim? So <b>shortsighted</b>.
