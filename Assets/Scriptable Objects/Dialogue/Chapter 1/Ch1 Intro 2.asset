    dialogue:
    - "A warmth fills you, or more accurately, you fill the warmth. Your soul quickly
      reknitting its ties to its familiar matter. The dragon\u2019s voice now more
      distant but still clear."

    dialogue:
    - "You\u2019ve now engaged the Phantom Activation and Reanimation Technology,
      that makes use of your unique situation of being both attached and detached
      from the physical realm, which allows you to travel back in time and visit
      and move your body, or parts in your case."
    - Unfortunately you can only visit them while they are both unperceived and not
      yet rotted away, so please avoid people and such.
    - "Alright here we are, normally I\u2019d tell you to get up and take a stroll
      around, but it seems your bodily state may give us some complications on that
      front, so just have a look, I suppose."
    - This location contains your head, torso, and leg. Make sure to get along, and
      good luck.
