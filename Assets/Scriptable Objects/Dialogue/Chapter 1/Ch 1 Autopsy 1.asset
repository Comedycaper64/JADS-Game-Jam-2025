    dialogue:
    - How fortuitous, this appears to be our autopsy report. Allow me a moment to
      parse its contents.

    - Fresh ink. Messy handwriting. Lengthy document.

    dialogue:
    - This should make things easier. Knowing my cause of death is a useful clue.

    dialogue:
    - "Pay attention. We suffered rather horribly, so I shall summarise it for expediency\u2019s
      sake. The cadaver\u2019s name is \u201CJake R. Hackner\u201D."
    - Blunt force trauma on the body and head, indicating a possible concussion.
      A knife-wound on the nose, cleaving away most of it. This wound was amateurly
      treated.
    - The hands were severed by a clean cut with almost surgical precision. The body
      was heavily compressed, leading to the severance of one leg at the knee. Blood
      found near a trash compactor matches ours.
    - The left eye is missing, but that is due to a prior injury. That is to say,
      we lost an eye some time ago in an unrelated incident.

    dialogue:
    - "Christ\u2026 somebody must\u2019ve really had it out for me."
    - Did I get tortured and dismembered by a gang? If I was in a trash compactor,
      maybe they were hiding my body?
    - "What a way to go\u2026"
